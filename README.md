#### Good to Know

- **Flash is Old:** Flash is super old tech. Anything that uses it (including the stuff to run it) is a big security risk, even if nothing seems harmful.

- **Everything is tracked and permanently stored:** Every time you log in your login time and IP are saved permanently in the Project Pandanda database. Every time you send a message, not only that it is permanently recorded but it seems that they are actually actively reading the messages.

- **Modding Risks:** If they catch you with a modded client, even if it is harmless, they will ban you. Be careful! <3

Have fun!
