### Overview

This website is just a quick proof of concept to show off a few little mods for Project Pandanda. If you want to try it yourself, check out the guide [here](https://github.com/pdmods/guide). Everything will be taken down soon, so download whatever you need while itâ€™s still here.

#### Good to Know

- **Flash is Old:** Flash is super old tech. Anything that uses it (including the stuff to run it) is a big security risk, even if nothing seems harmful.

- **Everything is tracked and permanently stored:** Every time you log in here (or on their original site), your login time and IP are saved permanently in the Project Pandanda database. Every time you send a message, it is permanently recorded too.


- **Modding Risks:** If they catch you with a modded client, even if it is harmless, they will ban you. Be careful! <3

Have fun!
