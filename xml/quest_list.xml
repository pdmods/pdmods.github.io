	Good day, my friend! You probably know who Farmer Dan is. Yeah, the guy with the bunnies who also offers the best milk for my icecream. I've decided that I'd like to return the favor and help him out with finding some of his lost bunnies. Since I'm pretty busy experimenting here with new flavors and I need to visit Lisa later, could you help me out with finding some of those bunnies? All I know about them is that they're gray and they're not in the urban areas of our Land. Watch out for the grass shaking - that may be a clear sign of those bunnies hiding behind a patch!
			</TEXTSTART>

	Those gray bunnies may be hiding very well. You need to look carefully around rural areas. Oh, and watch out - they are hiding behind patches of grass and you should notice when some grass is shaking.

Howdy, how's it been going for you recently? Is the egg hunt going well for you? I, personally, can say that an egg is a rare claim for some Pandas. I believe that it's because the brown chicken, which are not inside the barn, are losing feather. The white hens don't give a lot of eggs, though. Could you please get some eggs from the white chicken in my barn in order to get some eggs for the Pandas and find some feather that my brown chicken have lost?
		</TEXTSTART>
	    	<TEXTACTIVE>
I need you to find the feather that's fallen off my brown chicken, it's perhaps happening because they don't live in the barn. And, speaking of my barn, please visit the white hens in there in order to get some eggs for coloring.

	    	<TEXTEND>
Great, those eggs are enough for now. I'll use the feather for something. Thanks for your hard work.

Hey there Panda, I need your help! Tonight, Izzy will be cooking her famous mushroom soup to be served on the Old East Town Center's feast. However, in my daily walk around, I stumbled upon some seemingly edible mushrooms growing in the fields, that were in fact some of the most poisonous species ever found around these lands. A less experienced panda, like Izzy, may collect those by mistake, turning the delicious dinner into a hazard to all Pandas. Could you help me and collect them before Izzy does?

Check out the pictures I gave you as objectives, they'll help you identify the mushrooms.

	    <TEXTEND>
Yay, you found them, you have a good eye Panda! I'm glad you learned a lesson with ol' Questy. It's really important to distinguish edible mushroom species from poisonous ones, as the last ones are toxic and are very dangerous for our bodies. However, that is no easy task! Some of them are really easy to differentiate, but others are very identical to the ones we can eat. You should always get advice from an experienced mushroom collector, as they know the guidelines to safely pick those delicious mushrooms!

I really want to try fishing, I'm so excited!

Oh my god, thank you very much! Will you join and show me some techniques later? I've heard that you're very experienced in fishing!

Hey! I'm in dire need of help! During my cleaning session, my garbage bag got hung on some tree branches and ended up tearing apart! All the trash fell down towards the Old East Town. You may ask youself why am I asking you for help, this is not a big deal. Trust me, I would go there myself, but... Today is my 10 year anniversary with Tammy! So... Can you please help me? I put a sign towards the Old East Town on the right-most lamp.

This old place is giving me an idea. Me and Tammy have been looking to move onto the island for a while, but we never really had any available place to move in to! The trip from home to here is honestly time consuming, and with our marriage anniversary coming up... I believe we could use this place for our housing area and give it a new meaning? I'm sure the rest will agree with this idea. Hit up Paige, and she should send the message to the rest of the people.

Well? Have you talked to Paige yet? I can't wait to hear her opinion on this!

This is certainly an interesting idea. Let me forward it to the rest and I'll tell you the result after some time.

Hey! Good news! I've been talking to the other island residents and from the looks of it, they all agree! It's a wonderful idea. However Jim, my husband, brought up the fact that we will need some materials for all the buildings. Not only that, we also need to clean up the whole place before building. But no worries about cleaning, Steve and Tammy offered to clean up the whole place! Your job is to find as many logs and iron ore as you can for any planks, nails or other things we need.

You should find any of the materials we need in the Forest.

Hiya! I can't stop thinking about that huge tree near the entrance of the Old Town! I overheard Jim and Elmhurst talking about cutting it and using it to make furniture! Such an old and marvelous tree cannot be used just for furniture! It has to live and prosper! So, I need your help for this little plan of mine. I'll go convince them not to cut it and you go grab some dirt so we can move into a new location, maybe around the benches?
		</TEXTSTART>
		<TEXTACTIVE>
It would be best to look for dirt somewhere in the forest, since the soil is very rich there!
		</TEXTACTIVE>
		<TEXTEND>
Great! I managed to convice them in the meanwhile! Don't worry about moving the tree either, it looks like after my speech they got motivated to move it by themselves!
